# SymPy Installation and Testing Guide

## Successfully Completed Steps

1. **Repository Clone**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sympy/sympy.git
   cd sympy
   ```

2. **Dependencies Installation**
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip python3-dev
   ```

3. **Package Installation**
   ```bash
   python3 -m pip install -e .
   ```
   This step successfully installed SymPy in development mode along with its dependency mpmath.

## Manual Testing Instructions

Since the automated test suite is extensive, here are the steps for manual testing:

1. **Install Test Dependencies**
   ```bash
   python3 -m pip install pytest
   ```

2. **Run Full Test Suite**
   ```bash
   python3 setup.py test
   ```
   Note: The full test suite may take a considerable amount of time to complete.

3. **Alternative Testing Methods**
   - Run specific test files:
     ```bash
     pytest sympy/core/tests/test_basic.py
     ```
   - Run tests with specific markers:
     ```bash
     pytest -v -m "not slow"
     ```
   - Run tests in parallel (faster):
     ```bash
     pytest -n auto
     ```

4. **Basic Functionality Test**
   You can verify basic functionality by running Python and trying:
   ```python
   from sympy import symbols, solve
   x = symbols('x')
   solve(x**2 + 2*x + 1, x)
   ```

## Verification of Installation

To verify that SymPy is installed correctly, you can run:
```python
python3 -c "import sympy; print(sympy.__version__)"
```

## Notes
- The installation was successful, with all dependencies properly resolved
- The package was installed in development mode, allowing for modifications
- Test suite execution requires significant time due to the comprehensive nature of tests
- For development purposes, running specific test files or markers is recommended instead of the full suite
