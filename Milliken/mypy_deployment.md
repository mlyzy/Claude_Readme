# Mypy Deployment and Testing Report

## Installation Process

1. Created working directory and cloned the repository:
```bash
mkdir -p /tmp/mypy_test && cd /tmp/mypy_test
git clone https://github.com/python/mypy.git
```

2. Installed system dependencies:
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y python3-pip python3-venv build-essential
```

3. Set up Python virtual environment and installed the project:
```bash
cd /tmp/mypy_test/mypy
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .
```

4. Installed test dependencies:
```bash
pip install pytest pytest-xdist pytest-cov lxml
```

## Test Results

The test suite was run using pytest. Here's a summary of the results:

* Total tests: 12,722
* Passed: 12,333
* Failed: 5
* Skipped: 369
* XFailed: 14
* Errors: 1
* Total time: 362.53s (6:02)

### Failed Tests

2. `testImports` in `mypyc/test/test_run.py`
   - Issue: Missing psutil module dependency

3. `testAttrWithSlots` in `mypyc/test/test_run.py`
   - Issue: Missing attr module dependency

4. `testRunAttrsclassNonAuto` in `mypyc/test/test_run.py`
   - Issue: Missing attr module dependency

5. `testRunAttrsclass` in `mypyc/test/test_run.py`

### Errors

   - Issue: Missing filelock module dependency

## Required Dependencies for Manual Deployment

To fix the failing tests, the following additional dependencies need to be installed:

```bash
pip install attrs filelock psutil
```

## Conclusion

The mypy project was successfully installed but some tests are failing due to missing dependencies. The core functionality appears to be working as the majority of tests passed (12,333 out of 12,722). To get a fully passing test suite, the missing dependencies need to be installed.

## Recommendations

1. Install all required dependencies before running tests:
```bash
pip install attrs filelock psutil
```

2. Run tests again after installing dependencies
3. Consider adding these dependencies to the project's test requirements to prevent similar issues in future deployments
