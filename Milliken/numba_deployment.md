# Numba Project Deployment Process and Issues

## Overview
This document describes the attempted deployment process for the Numba project and outlines the steps for manual deployment.

## System Requirements
- Python 3.x
- LLVM
- Build tools (build-essential)
- Python development headers
- pip package manager

## Installation Steps Attempted

1. **Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/numba/numba.git
```

2. **Install System Dependencies**
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y python3-dev python3-pip build-essential llvm
```

3. **Create and Activate Virtual Environment**
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

4. **Install Python Dependencies**
```bash
pip install numpy llvmlite setuptools wheel pytest
```

## Issues Encountered

The main issue encountered during installation was a dependency conflict with llvmlite. Specifically:

1. The current version of Numba requires `llvmlite<0.46,>=0.45.0dev0`, but this version is not available in PyPI.
2. The latest available version of llvmlite is 0.44.0, which does not meet the requirements.

## Manual Deployment Steps

To manually deploy Numba, follow these steps:

1. **Prepare the Environment**
   - Install system dependencies as shown above
   - Create and activate a virtual environment

2. **Install Compatible Versions**
   - Check the specific version requirements in setup.py
   - Install compatible versions of llvmlite and other dependencies
   - You may need to build llvmlite from source if required

3. **Build from Source**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/numba/numba.git
cd numba
python setup.py build_ext --inplace
pip install -e .
```

4. **Testing**
```bash
python -m pytest
```

## Additional Notes

- The project appears to have strict version dependencies that need to be carefully managed
- Building from source might require additional system-level dependencies
- Consider checking the official documentation for specific version compatibility requirements
- It may be necessary to use an older release of Numba that is compatible with the available llvmlite version

## Recommendation

Before attempting deployment:
1. Check the exact version requirements in the project's setup.py
2. Verify the compatibility matrix between Numba, llvmlite, and Python versions
3. Consider using a specific tagged release rather than the main branch
4. Review the project's issue tracker for any known installation problems
