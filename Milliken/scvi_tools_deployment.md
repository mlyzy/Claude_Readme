# scvi-tools Manual Deployment Guide

## Overview
This document outlines the process for manually deploying scvi-tools, a deep probabilistic analysis framework for single-cell omics data.

## System Requirements
- Python 3.8 or later
- CUDA-compatible GPU (recommended for large datasets)
- At least 8GB RAM
- Linux, macOS, or Windows operating system

## Installation Steps

### 1. Environment Setup
```bash
# Create and activate a new Python virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .\venv\Scripts\activate

# Upgrade pip
pip install --upgrade pip
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
The project requires several key dependencies:
- PyTorch
- Anndata
- Scanpy
- Rich
- Lightning

You can install these either manually or through the package installation process.

### 3. Install scvi-tools
There are multiple ways to install scvi-tools:

#### Option A: Install from PyPI (Recommended for users)
```bash
pip install scvi-tools
```

#### Option B: Install from source (Recommended for developers)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/scverse/scvi-tools.git
cd scvi-tools
pip install -e ".[dev,docs,test]"
```

### 4. Additional Development Dependencies
For development purposes, install additional dependencies:
```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"  # Development dependencies
pip install -e ".[docs]"  # Documentation dependencies
pip install -e ".[test]"  # Testing dependencies
```

### 5. Testing the Installation

#### Basic Import Test
```python
import scvi
print(scvi.__version__)
```

#### Run Test Suite
```bash
pytest tests/
```

## Common Issues and Solutions

1. **Memory Issues During Installation**
   - Try installing with fewer extra dependencies
   - Use a machine with more RAM
   - Install dependencies one at a time

2. **CUDA/GPU Issues**
   - Ensure CUDA toolkit is properly installed
   - Check PyTorch installation matches CUDA version
   - Can run on CPU only, but will be slower

3. **Package Conflicts**
   - Create a fresh virtual environment
   - Install dependencies in order of importance
   - Check version compatibility

## Note
This is a complex package with many dependencies. If you encounter issues:
1. Check the official documentation
2. Search existing GitHub issues
3. Create a new issue with detailed error information
4. Consider using pre-built containers if available
