# DLT Project Deployment Guide

## Overview
This document outlines the process of deploying and testing the DLT (Data Load Tool) project. The project requires several dependencies and has multiple optional components that can be installed based on specific needs.

## Installation Process

### 1. Basic Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/dlt-hub/dlt.git
cd dlt

# Install the basic package
python3 -m pip install -e .
```

### 2. Required Dependencies for Testing
The following dependencies are needed to run the test suite:

```bash
# Core testing dependencies
pip install pytest pytest-cov pytest-mock pytest-console-scripts pytest-asyncio

# Database dependencies
pip install duckdb psycopg2-binary

# Authentication and encryption
pip install cryptography

# DBT integration
pip install dbt-core

# Web dependencies
pip install requests_mock marimo

# Cloud service dependencies
pip install google-cloud-bigquery

# SQL related
pip install sqlfluff pyodbc sqlalchemy

# Vector databases
pip install qdrant-client weaviate-client

# ClickHouse support
pip install clickhouse-driver clickhouse-connect

# Other dependencies
pip install playwright deltalake
```

### 3. Optional Components
Depending on your needs, you may want to install additional components:

- For SQL database support: `pip install "dlt[sql_database]"`
- For Delta Lake support: `pip install "dlt[deltalake]"`
- For specific cloud providers: Install relevant SDK packages

## Known Issues

1. **Dependency Conflicts**: There are known conflicts with protobuf versions:
   - dbt-related packages require protobuf<6.0,>=5.0
   - Some installed packages use protobuf 6.x

2. **Testing Infrastructure**: The test suite requires numerous dependencies and may fail if specific database servers or services are not available.

## Manual Deployment Steps

1. **Environment Setup**:
   - Set up a Python virtual environment
   - Install Python 3.x (preferably 3.11 or later)
   - Set up required database instances if needed

2. **Configuration**:
   - Configure database connections
   - Set up authentication credentials
   - Configure logging and monitoring

3. **Testing**:
   - Run basic tests: `python -m pytest tests/`
   - Test specific components as needed
   - Verify database connections

4. **Production Deployment**:
   - Set up proper logging
   - Configure error handling
   - Set up monitoring
   - Deploy with appropriate security measures

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and their solutions:

1. **Missing Dependencies**:
   - Install missing packages as they are encountered
   - Check for compatible versions
   - Use virtual environments to avoid conflicts

2. **Database Connection Issues**:
   - Verify database credentials
   - Check network connectivity
   - Ensure database servers are running

3. **Test Failures**:
   - Check for missing dependencies
   - Verify environment configuration
   - Ensure all required services are available

## Next Steps

- Set up automated testing
- Configure CI/CD pipeline
- Document API usage
- Set up monitoring and alerting
- Create backup and recovery procedures
