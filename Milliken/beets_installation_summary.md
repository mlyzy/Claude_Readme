```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

pip install resampy requests-mock pytest-aiohttp aioresponses
```

## Test Results

- Total tests: 1967
- Passed: 1867 (94.9%)
- Skipped: 88 (4.5%)
- XFailed (expected failures): 9 (0.5%)
- Errors: 3 (0.2%)
- Warnings: 3

### Skipped Tests Breakdown

Main categories of skipped tests:
1. ReplayGain plugin tests (45 tests) - Missing dependencies:
   - GStreamer
   - FFmpeg
   - *gain commands

2. Platform-specific tests:
   - Windows/macOS specific features
   - File system specific features (reflink, case sensitivity)

3. Integration tests requiring external services:

   - Lyrics source tests

4. Unimplemented features or missing dependencies:
   - Specific importer features
   - PIL (Python Imaging Library) related tests
   - Unrar program dependency

### Errors (3)

3. test_albums

### XFailed Tests (9)

## Conclusion

The installation and testing process was largely successful, with 94.9% of tests passing. The majority of skipped tests are due to missing optional dependencies or platform-specific features. The remaining errors are confined to a single plugin (Aura) and appear to be related to test configuration rather than core functionality.

The project appears to be in a healthy state, with most core functionality working as expected. The failed tests are well-documented and mostly related to expected failures in specific plugin implementations.
