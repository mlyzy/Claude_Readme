# Chart.js Installation and Testing

## Project Overview
Chart.js is a popular JavaScript library for creating responsive and interactive charts using HTML5 Canvas. It supports various chart types including line, bar, radar, doughnut, pie, polar area, bubble, and scatter charts.

## Installation Process

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18+ recommended)
- pnpm (v8+ required as specified in package.json)

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/chartjs/Chart.js.git
cd Chart.js
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies
Chart.js uses pnpm as its package manager. The installation of dependencies was successful with:
```bash
pnpm install
```

This installed all the required dependencies, including development tools like rollup, TypeScript, and testing frameworks.

### Step 3: Build the Project
The build process was executed successfully using:
```bash
pnpm build
```

This command generated the following outputs:
- `dist/chart.js` - ES module
- `dist/chart.cjs` - CommonJS module
- `dist/chart.umd.js` - UMD bundle for browser usage
- Type definitions in the `dist/types/` directory

Some circular dependency warnings were observed during the build process, but they did not prevent the successful completion of the build.

## Testing the Project

### Creating a Test HTML
A simple HTML test file was created to test the Chart.js library:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Chart.js Test</title>
    <script src="dist/chart.umd.js"></script>
    <style>
        .chart-container {
            width: 800px;
            height: 400px;
            margin: 20px auto;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <div class="chart-container">
        <canvas id="myChart"></canvas>
    </div>

    <script>
        // Create a new chart
        const ctx = document.getElementById('myChart');
        const myChart = new Chart(ctx, {
            type: 'bar',
            data: {
                labels: ['Red', 'Blue', 'Yellow', 'Green', 'Purple', 'Orange'],
                datasets: [{
                    label: '# of Votes',
                    data: [12, 19, 3, 5, 2, 3],
                    backgroundColor: [
                        'rgba(255, 99, 132, 0.2)',
                        'rgba(54, 162, 235, 0.2)',
                        'rgba(255, 206, 86, 0.2)',
                        'rgba(75, 192, 192, 0.2)',
                        'rgba(153, 102, 255, 0.2)',
                        'rgba(255, 159, 64, 0.2)'
                    ],
                    borderColor: [
                        'rgba(255, 99, 132, 1)',
                        'rgba(54, 162, 235, 1)',
                        'rgba(255, 206, 86, 1)',
                        'rgba(75, 192, 192, 1)',
                        'rgba(153, 102, 255, 1)',
                        'rgba(255, 159, 64, 1)'
                    ],
                    borderWidth: 1
                }]
            },
            options: {
                scales: {
                    y: {
                        beginAtZero: true
                    }
                }
            }
        });
    </script>
</body>
</html>
```

### Running Tests
The HTTP server was set up using Python's built-in HTTP server:
```bash
python3 -m http.server 8081
```

Due to limitations in the test environment, visual confirmation of the chart rendering was not possible. However, the server was able to serve the test HTML file successfully, indicating that the basic setup works.

## Conclusion

The Chart.js library was successfully:
1. Cloned from GitHub
2. Dependencies were installed using pnpm
3. The project was built successfully using the build script
4. A test HTML file was created and served via HTTP server

This confirms that the Chart.js project can be successfully deployed. For full testing in a production environment, a proper browser with visual interface would be required.

## Additional Notes

- The project uses rollup for bundling
- TypeScript for type definitions
- The library has a minimal dependency footprint with only one runtime dependency: @kurkle/color
- Circular dependencies were detected during build, but did not affect functionality
- The project uses a modular architecture with separate modules for different chart types
