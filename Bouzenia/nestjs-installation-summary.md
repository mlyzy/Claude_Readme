# NestJS Installation and Testing Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the process of downloading, installing, and testing the [NestJS](https://github.com/nestjs/nest) framework.

## Installation Process

### Prerequisites
- Node.js v20+ and npm v10+
- Git for cloning the repository

### Step 1: Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/nestjs/nest.git
cd nest
```

### Step 2: Install dependencies
```bash
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```
The `--legacy-peer-deps` flag was necessary to handle dependency conflicts. Several deprecation warnings were shown during installation, but they did not prevent the installation from completing.

### Step 3: Build the project
```bash
npm run build
```
The build process compiles the TypeScript code for multiple packages:
- common
- core
- websockets
- microservices
- platform-express
- platform-fastify
- platform-socket.io
- platform-ws
- testing

## Testing the Project

### Running a Sample Application
The repository includes multiple sample applications. We tested the basic "cats-app" example:

1. Navigate to the sample directory:
```bash
cd sample/01-cats-app
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Build the application:
```bash
npm run build
```

4. Start the application:
```bash
npm run start:dev
```

The application runs successfully on http://localhost:4000 (default port is 3000, but was changed to avoid conflicts).

### API Testing
The sample application provides a REST API for managing cats:

1. Get all cats:
```bash
curl http://localhost:4000/cats
```
Response: `{"data":[]}`

2. Create a new cat:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/cats -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name": "Whiskers", "age": 3, "breed": "Persian"}'
```

3. Verify the cat was created:
```bash
curl http://localhost:4000/cats
```
Response: `{"data":[{"name":"Whiskers","age":3,"breed":"Persian"}]}`

## Project Structure
NestJS follows a modular architecture:
- `packages/` - Core NestJS packages
- `sample/` - Example applications demonstrating various features
- `integration/` - Integration tests

## Conclusion
The NestJS project was successfully deployed and tested. The framework provides a robust, modular architecture for building server-side applications with TypeScript. The sample applications demonstrate the framework's capabilities for building RESTful APIs with features like validation, dependency injection, and more.
