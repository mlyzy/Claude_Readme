## Notes

1. Pandas uses a meson-based build system.
2. The build process requires the ninja build system, which must be installed separately.
3. The development version of pandas is not recommended for production use.
4. The repository contains extensive tests, but running all of them would take a long time.
5. Pandas is a mature and well-maintained library with good test coverage.

## Conclusion

The pandas library was successfully built and installed from source. Basic functionality and selected unit tests are working as expected. The installation process requires several dependencies, but once properly set up, the library functions correctly.
