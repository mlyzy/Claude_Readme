# Keras Deployment Guide

## Environment Setup
The deployment was attempted on an Ubuntu system with Python 3.11. Here's the process and results:

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+ (Python 3.11 was used)
- pip package manager
- git

### Installation Steps

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/keras-team/keras
cd keras
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -e .
pip install tensorflow numpy pytest pytest-cov
```

### Installation Results
- Core Keras package was successfully installed
- TensorFlow and other dependencies were successfully installed
- The system is running on CPU only (no CUDA drivers detected)

### Testing Status
Attempted to run tests but encountered issues with test directory location. The following issues were observed:
- Tests directory structure appears different from expected
- Some TensorFlow-related warnings appeared but these are not critical errors
- GPU support is not available (this is expected on CPU-only systems)

### Manual Deployment Steps
For anyone wanting to deploy this project, follow these steps:

1. System Requirements:
   - Python 3.8 or higher
   - pip package manager
   - git
   - (Optional) CUDA drivers for GPU support

2. Installation:
   ```bash
   # Clone the repository
   git clone https://github.com/keras-team/keras
   cd keras

   # Create virtual environment
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate

   # Install Keras and dependencies
   pip install -e .
   pip install tensorflow numpy pytest pytest-cov
   ```

3. Verification:
   - Import Keras in Python to verify installation:
   ```python
   import keras
   print(keras.__version__)
   ```

4. Known Issues:
   - Test suite location may vary depending on the version
   - CUDA-related warnings will appear on systems without GPU support
   - Some TensorFlow optimizations may not be available depending on CPU architecture

### Additional Notes
- The installation process completed successfully despite test directory issues
- The core functionality should work as expected
- GPU support requires additional CUDA setup if needed
- For production deployments, consider using specific versions of dependencies
