# nlohmann/json Library Deployment Report

## Attempted Installation Process

The following steps were attempted for automated installation:

1. System preparation:
   - Attempted to synchronize system time with NTP servers
   - Tried to update package repositories
   - Attempted to install build dependencies

2. Repository cloning:
   - Successfully cloned the repository from https://github.com/nlohmann/json.git

3. Build attempt:
   - Could not proceed with build due to missing build tools (cmake, build-essential)

## Manual Deployment Instructions

### Prerequisites

Before starting the deployment, ensure you have the following installed:

1. Build essentials:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install build-essential
   ```

2. CMake (version 3.1 or higher):
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install cmake
   ```

3. Git:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install git
   ```

### Step-by-Step Deployment Process

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nlohmann/json.git
   cd json
   ```

2. Create and enter build directory:
   ```bash
   mkdir build
   cd build
   ```

3. Configure with CMake:
   ```bash
   cmake ..
   ```

4. Build the project:
   ```bash
   make
   ```

5. Run tests (optional):
   ```bash
   make test
   ```

### Alternative Installation Methods

#### Header-only Installation
The library is header-only, so you can simply:
1. Download the single header file from:
   https://github.com/nlohmann/json/releases
2. Include it in your project:
   ```cpp
   #include <nlohmann/json.hpp>
   ```

#### Package Manager Installation

1. Using vcpkg:
   ```bash
   vcpkg install nlohmann-json
   ```

2. Using Conan:
   ```bash
   conan install nlohmann_json/3.11.2
   ```

3. Using Hunter:
   ```cmake
   hunter_add_package(nlohmann_json)
   ```

### Basic Usage Example

```cpp
#include <nlohmann/json.hpp>
using json = nlohmann::json;

int main() {
    // Create a JSON object
    json j = {
        {"name", "John Doe"},
        {"age", 30},
        {"address", {
            {"street", "123 Main St"},
            {"city", "Anytown"},
            {"country", "USA"}
        }}
    };

    // Serialize to string
    std::string serialized = j.dump(4);  // 4 spaces indent

    // Parse JSON string
    json parsed = json::parse(serialized);

    return 0;
}
```

### Troubleshooting

1. CMake configuration fails:
   - Verify CMake version (>= 3.1)
   - Ensure all dependencies are installed
   - Check CMake error messages for specific issues

2. Build failures:
   - Verify compiler supports C++11
   - Check for compiler-specific errors
   - Ensure sufficient system resources

3. Test failures:
   - Check test logs for specific failures
   - Verify system meets minimum requirements
   - Ensure all dependencies are properly installed
