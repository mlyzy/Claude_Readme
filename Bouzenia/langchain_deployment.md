# LangChain Project Manual Deployment Guide

## Overview
This document outlines the process for manually deploying the LangChain project and the requirements needed for successful deployment.

## Prerequisites
1. Python 3.8+ installed
2. pip (Python package installer)
3. Git
4. Virtual environment capability (python3-venv)
5. Access to command line interface

## Installation Steps

### 1. System Preparation
```bash
# Update system and install required packages
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y python3-pip python3-venv git
```

### 2. Repository Setup
```bash
# Create and navigate to project directory
mkdir langchain
cd langchain

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain.git .
```

### 3. Virtual Environment Setup
```bash
# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 4. Package Installation
```bash
# Install the package in editable mode with all dependencies
pip install -e ".[all]"

# Alternative: Install core packages
pip install langchain

# Install development dependencies
pip install pytest
```

### 5. Configuration
1. Set up any necessary environment variables:
   - OpenAI API key (if using OpenAI models)
   - Other API keys based on the integrations you plan to use

### 6. Testing
```bash
# Run tests
python -m pytest tests/
```

## Known Issues and Solutions

1. Package Installation Issues:
   - If `pip install -e ".[all]"` fails, try installing individual components
   - Make sure you're using a compatible Python version
   - Check that all system dependencies are installed

2. Testing Issues:
   - Ensure all test dependencies are installed
   - Make sure you're in the correct directory
   - Some tests may require specific API keys or configurations

## Additional Requirements

1. API Keys:
   - OpenAI API key (for GPT models)
   - Other API keys based on specific integrations

2. Computing Resources:
   - Sufficient RAM (recommended: 4GB+)
   - Adequate disk space
   - Stable internet connection

## Troubleshooting

1. If you encounter permission errors:
   - Ensure you have proper permissions in the installation directory
   - Use sudo when necessary for system-wide installations

2. If packages fail to install:
   - Check Python version compatibility
   - Update pip: `pip install --upgrade pip`
   - Install packages individually to identify problematic dependencies

3. If tests fail:
   - Check if all required dependencies are installed
   - Verify environment variables are set correctly
   - Look for specific error messages in the test output

## Notes
- The installation process might vary depending on your operating system and environment
- Some features might require additional setup or configuration
- Always refer to the official documentation for the most up-to-date information
