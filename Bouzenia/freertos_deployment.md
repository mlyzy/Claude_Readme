# FreeRTOS Deployment Guide

## Overview
FreeRTOS is a real-time operating system kernel designed for embedded systems. This guide outlines the requirements and steps for deploying FreeRTOS on embedded hardware.

## Prerequisites

1. Hardware Requirements:
   - A compatible microcontroller or development board (e.g., ARM Cortex-M, ESP32, etc.)
   - Programming/debugging interface (e.g., JTAG, SWD)

2. Software Requirements:
   - Cross-compiler toolchain for your target architecture
   - CMake (version 3.15 or later)
   - IDE or development environment (recommended: Visual Studio Code, Eclipse, or IAR Workbench)
   - Debugging tools compatible with your hardware

## Installation Steps

1. Clone the Repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/FreeRTOS/FreeRTOS.git
   ```

2. Configure Build Environment:
   - Select appropriate compiler toolchain for your target hardware
   - Set up environment variables for your toolchain
   - Configure project settings for your specific hardware

3. Project Structure:
   - `/FreeRTOS/Source`: Core FreeRTOS kernel source
   - `/FreeRTOS/Demo`: Example projects for various platforms
   - `/FreeRTOS-Plus`: Additional libraries and integrations

4. Building the Project:
   - Choose appropriate demo project for your hardware
   - Configure FreeRTOSConfig.h for your application needs
   - Build using your toolchain's build system

5. Deployment:
   - Flash the compiled binary to your target hardware
   - Use appropriate debugging tools to verify operation

## Testing Process

1. Hardware Testing:
   - Connect your development board
   - Flash the compiled program
   - Monitor system behavior through debug interface

2. Software Verification:
   - Verify task scheduling
   - Test inter-task communication
   - Validate memory management
   - Check interrupt handling

## Important Notes

1. FreeRTOS cannot be run directly on a desktop operating system - it requires embedded hardware.
2. Different hardware platforms require different configuration and setup steps.
3. Refer to the specific demo project documentation for your target hardware.
4. The FreeRTOS kernel is highly configurable - review FreeRTOSConfig.h settings carefully.

## Common Issues and Troubleshooting

1. Build Issues:
   - Verify toolchain installation and configuration
   - Check path settings and environment variables
   - Ensure all dependencies are installed

2. Runtime Issues:
   - Check stack sizes and heap configuration
   - Verify interrupt priorities
   - Monitor task priorities and scheduling

3. Hardware Issues:
   - Verify hardware connections
   - Check power supply stability
   - Ensure proper clock configuration
