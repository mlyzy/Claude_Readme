# MyBatis-3 Project Deployment Guide

This guide outlines the manual deployment process for the MyBatis-3 project.

## Prerequisites

1. Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
   - Download from: https://adoptium.net/ or https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/
   - Set JAVA_HOME environment variable
   - Add Java to system PATH

2. Apache Maven 3.6.x or higher
   - Download from: https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi
   - Add Maven to system PATH

3. Git

## Deployment Steps

1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mybatis/mybatis-3.git
   cd mybatis-3
   ```

2. Build the project
   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```

3. Run the tests
   ```bash
   mvn test
   ```

## Expected Results

After successful deployment:
- All unit tests should pass
- The build should complete successfully
- The following artifacts should be generated in the target directory:
  - mybatis-3.x.x.jar
  - mybatis-3.x.x-sources.jar
  - mybatis-3.x.x-javadoc.jar

## Common Issues and Solutions

1. Build Failures
   - Ensure all prerequisites are properly installed
   - Check Java version compatibility
   - Verify Maven settings.xml configuration

2. Test Failures
   - Ensure no conflicting processes are running
   - Check system resources (memory, disk space)
   - Verify database connectivity if required by tests

## Integration

To use MyBatis in your project:

1. Add the dependency to your pom.xml:
   ```xml
   <dependency>
     <groupId>org.mybatis</groupId>
     <artifactId>mybatis</artifactId>
     <version>${mybatis.version}</version>
   </dependency>
   ```

2. Configure MyBatis in your application:
   - Create configuration XML file
   - Set up database connection
   - Define mappers
