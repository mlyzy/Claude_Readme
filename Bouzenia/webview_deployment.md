# Webview Project Deployment Guide

## Prerequisites

The webview project requires the following dependencies:

1. C/C++ compiler (build-essential)
2. CMake build system
3. WebKit2GTK development libraries
4. GTK3 development libraries

## Installation Steps

1. Install system dependencies:
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y build-essential cmake libwebkit2gtk-4.0-dev libgtk-3-dev
```

2. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/webview/webview.git
cd webview
```

3. Build the project:
```bash
# Create build directory
mkdir build
cd build

# Generate build files
cmake ..

# Build the project
make
```

4. Run the examples:
```bash
# Basic example
./examples/basic

# Custom CSS example
./examples/custom-css

# Bind example
./examples/bind
```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter package installation issues:

1. Try using a different package mirror:
```bash
# Make a backup of your sources.list
sudo cp /etc/apt/sources.list /etc/apt/sources.list.backup

# Edit sources.list to use a different mirror
sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list
```

2. If the issue persists, you can manually download and install the .deb packages:
```bash
# Example for libwebkit2gtk-4.0-dev
wget http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/w/webkitgtk/libwebkit2gtk-4.0-dev_2.XX.X-X_amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i libwebkit2gtk-4.0-dev_2.XX.X-X_amd64.deb
```

## Note

The installation was not completed successfully due to package repository connectivity issues. The above instructions provide the complete manual deployment process that should be followed once the connectivity issues are resolved.
